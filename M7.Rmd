## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
NYC311 <- read_csv("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/erm2-nwe9.csv?%24select=Created_Date,Agency,Complaint_Type,Incident_Address,Location")
head(NYC311)
```

Data is messy because multiple characters in one collum/ data overload in colum 4. 
values of longitude and latitude are expressed as characters instead of numbers.
every colum is not one variable accroding to tidy data. 


```{r}
latitude_and_longitude <- NYC311 %>% 
  separate(Location, into = c("point", "latitude", "longitude"), sep = " ") %>%
  select(-point) 
latitude_and_longitude

```

```{r}
NYC
```
